# ICE BOX ITEMS 
As a admin user, I want be able to authorise people to join the groups, because some users might want to share their struggles only people in similar situations/addiction.
‌

As a user, I want to be able to view all my posts in one page, so I can revisit them, update or delete them with ease.
‌

As a user, I want to be able to create meeting calls, so that other people can join and share.
‌

As a user, I want to have full control of the meeting room I’m creating, including number of participants, date and time, so I can feel as comfortable as possible to share my experience.
